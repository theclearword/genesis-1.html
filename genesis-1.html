  <p class="chapter">1</p>

  <p class="verse">In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. The Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.</p>

  <p class="verse">God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. God saw the light, that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. God called the light “Day,” and the darkness he called “Night.” There was evening and there was morning — one day.</p>

  <p class="verse">God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.</p>

    <p><strong>Why "expanse"?</strong> The Hebrew word <em>raqia</em> refers to a solid dome in ancient cosmology. We keep it literal, not "sky" or "firmament," so readers can see the original worldview.</p>
