  <p class="chapter">1</p>

  <p class="verse">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made.</p>

  <p class="verse">In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p>

  <p class="verse">There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but was sent to testify about the light.</p>

  <p class="verse">The true light that enlightens every person was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own did not receive him. But to as many as received him, to those who believe in his name, he gave the right to become children of God — not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>

  <p class="verse">The Word became flesh and lived among us. We have seen his glory, glory as of the one and only from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <p><strong>“The Word became flesh”</strong>: The Greek <em>logos</em> (Word) echoes the divine wisdom of God — now embodied in Yeshua (Jesus), not as a distant ruler, but as one who “lived among us” — literally, “tabernacled” or “pitched his tent” with us, like God in the wilderness.</p>
    
    <p><strong>“Children of God”</strong>: Not by lineage or ritual, but by trust and reception — a radical inclusion.</p>
